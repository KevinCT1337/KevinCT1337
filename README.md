* I live in the lovely city of [Middlesex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZBcTo2JxV3xcFaKS8) 🗺️  
* I have 2 dogs and a cat, one dog is a [Labradoodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradoodle), and the other is a [Shorkie](https://www.petmd.com/dog/breeds/shorkie). And well, my cat is a pretty generic grey house cat. 🐕🐈
* I program my own games, and occasionally some simple scripts on the side for small projects, nothing too fancy 💻
